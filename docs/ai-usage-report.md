# AI Usage Report

## Development Assistant
For this project, I utilized ChatGPT-5 Codex as a development assistant throughout the entire process.

## Iterative Build Process
I began by building the webpage step by step, starting with the HTML structure, followed by CSS styling, and finally JavaScript functionality. With AI’s support, I was able to quickly test and implement different ideas for features and layout.

## Experimentation and Simplification
Initially, I experimented with several advanced approaches suggested by the AI. While these solutions were effective, I decided to simplify and return to more foundational methods to ensure I fully understood each component. To do this, I created a new project file and repository (the one I ultimately submitted).

## Knowledge Transfer
From there, I transferred parts of the original code into the new project. With AI’s explanations, I was able to break down each section—first HTML, then CSS, and finally JavaScript—allowing me to clearly visualize and understand how each element worked independently before combining them into the final product.

## Documentation Support
In addition to coding support, I used AI to assist with documentation. It helped me draft the README and technical documentation files. For the AI usage report, I first wrote a draft of my personal experience, then refined it with AI’s help to ensure it was professional, clear, and well-structured.

## Overall Impact
Overall, AI played a significant role in both the development and documentation stages of this project, acting as a guide, tutor, and writing assistant.
